# staging
Spec files used in the [ublue-os/staging](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ublue-os/staging/) copr.

### Why "staging"?
These packages are intentionally temporary. If we have to upgrade something upstream or ship a package that does not yet exist upstream, they live here until upstream catches up and then are dropped.
